In regards to assignment that's pretty much clear about all the requirements 

- I choose ViewModel pattern to communicate better around the app especially the list of restaurants

- It can even better about the UI measuring if I got some more time

- NSCache helps to retrieve image from network even faster

- we can create BaseController for MapsView especially to avoid repeated code
